## Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive community. Before contributing, please take a moment to review our [Code of Conduct](https://www.google.com/search?q=./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

-----

## Finding Something to Work On

1.  **Explore the Issues:** Head over to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/mindfiredigital/ignix-ui/issues). This is the best place to find tasks.
2.  **Good First Issues:** Look for issues tagged with `good first issue` or `help wanted`. These are specifically prepared for new contributors.
3.  **Propose a New Feature:** If you have an idea for a new component or feature, please **open an issue first**. This allows us to discuss the feature and make sure it aligns with the project's goals before you start working on it.

## Contribution Workflow

### 1\. Setup Your Environment

First, get the project running on your local machine.

  - **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of the [Ignix UI repository](https://github.com/mindfiredigital/ignix-ui).
  - **Clone your forked repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ignix-ui.git
    cd ignix-ui
    ```
  - **Install dependencies:** This project uses `pnpm` as its package manager.
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

### 2\. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your changes. A descriptive name helps us understand what you're working on.

  - For new features: `feature/short-feature-description`
  - For bug fixes: `fix/short-bug-description`

<!-- end list -->

```bash
# Example for a new feature
git checkout -b feature/add-avatar-component

# Example for a bug fix
git checkout -b fix/button-alignment-issue
```

### 3\. Develop in Storybook (The Fun Part\!)

We use **Storybook** as our primary development environment. It allows you to build and test components in complete isolation, which is faster and more efficient.

  - **Create Component Files:** Navigate to `apps/storybook/src/components/` and create a new directory for your component (e.g., `button`). Inside, create your component file (e.g., `Button.tsx`).

  - **Create a Story File:** In the *same directory*, create a story file named `[component-name].stories.tsx` (e.g., `Button.stories.tsx`). This file will contain different visual test cases for your component.

    *Example `button.stories.tsx`:*

    ```tsx
     import { Button } from '.';

    export default {
      title: 'Components/Button',
      component: Button,
      parameters: {
        layout: 'centered',
      },
      tags: ['autodocs'],
      argTypes: {
        variant: {
          control: { type: 'select' },
          options: ['default', 'destructive', 'outline', 'secondary', 'ghost', 'link', 'subtle', 'elevated', 'glass', 'neon', 'pill', 'none'],
        },
        size: {
          control: { type: 'select' },
          options: ['xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg', 'xl', 'icon'],
        },
      },
    };

    export const Default = {
      args: {
        children: 'Click Me',
        variant: 'default',
        size: 'md',
      },
    };

    export const Success = {
      args: {
        children: 'Success',
        variant: 'success',
      },
    };

    export const Outline = {
      args: {
        children: 'Cancel',
        variant: 'outline',
      },
    };
    ```

  - **Launch Storybook:** Run the Storybook server from the **root directory**.

    ```bash
    pnpm storybook
    ```

    This will open a new browser tab. You can now build, view, and test your component in real-time\!

### 4\. Register Your Component

Once your component is built and works correctly in Storybook, register it so it can be used by others.

  - Open `packages/registry/components/` and create a new directory for your component (e.g., `button`).
  - Open `packages/registry/registry.json`.
  - Add a new entry for your component, following the structure of the existing components.

### 5\. Add Documentation

Now that your component is complete, add documentation for it.

  - Create a new MDX file in `apps/docs/docs/components/` (e.g., `button.mdx`).
  - Describe what your component does and provide usage examples.
  - Add a link to your new documentation page in the sidebar by editing the `apps/docs/sidebars.ts` file.

### 6\. Write Unit Tests

We require tests for all new features to maintain code quality.

  - Add test cases for your component in a file located alongside the component source code.
  - Ensure all tests pass before submitting your changes.
    ```bash
    pnpm vitest
    ```

### 7\. Commit and Push Your Changes

  - **Stage and Commit:** Add your changes and write a clear, descriptive commit message that follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat(component): add new avatar component with storybook and tests"
    ```
  - **Push to Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/add-avatar-component
    ```

### 8\. Create a Pull Request

  - Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click "Compare & pull request".
  - Set the base branch to `development`.
  - Fill out the Pull Request (PR) template with all the required information.
  - Click "Create pull request" to submit it for review.

-----

## Code Review Process

  - Once your PR is submitted, one or more maintainers will review it.
  - If changes are requested, simply make the updates on your branch and push them. Your PR will update automatically.
  - Once the PR is approved, a maintainer will merge it. Congratulations\! ðŸŽ‰
